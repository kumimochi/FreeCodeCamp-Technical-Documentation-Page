      <p>Go language is a programming language initially developed at Google in the year 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a statically-typed language having syntax similar to that of C. It provides garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capability, many advanced built-in types such as variable length arrays and key-value maps. It also provides a rich standard library. The Go programming language was launched in November 2009 and is used in some of the Google's production systems.<br><br>
        This tutorial is designed for software programmers with a need to understand the Go programming language from scratch. This tutorial will give you enough understanding on Go programming language from where you can take yourself to higher levels of expertise.</p>

    <section id="Overview" class="main-section"><header>Overview</header><p>
      Go is a general-purpose language designed with systems programming in mind. It was initially developed at Google in the year 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is strongly and statically typed, provides inbuilt support for garbage collection, and supports concurrent programming. <br><br>
Programs are constructed using packages, for efficient management of dependencies. Go programming implementations use a traditional compile and link model to generate executable binaries. The Go programming language was announced in November 2009 and is used in some of the Google's production systems.>
<br>
<h2>Features of Go Programming</h2>
<p>The most important features of Go programming are listed below −
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>Support for environment adopting patterns similar to dynamic languages. For example, type inference (x := 0 is valid declaration of a variable x of type int)</li>
    <li>Compilation time is fast.</li>
    <li>Inbuilt concurrency support: lightweight processes (via go routines), channels, select statement.</li>
    <li>Go programs are simple, concise, and safe.</li>
    <li>Support for Interfaces and Type embedding.</li>
    <li>Production of statically linked native binaries without external dependencies.</li>
    <br>
    <h2>Features Excluded Intentionally</h2>
    <p>To keep the language simple and concise, the following features commonly available in other similar languages are omitted in Go −</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Support for type inheritance</li>
      <li>Support for method or operator overloading</li>
      <li>Support for circular dependencies among packages</li>
      <li>Support for pointer arithmetic</li>
      <li>Support for assertions</li>
      <li>Support for generic programming</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
</p>

    <section id="Environment_Setup" class="main-section">
      <header>Environment Setup</header>
      <br>
      <h2>Local Environment Setup</h2>
      <p>If you are still willing to set up your environment for Go programming language, you need the following two software available on your computer −</p>
      <ul>
        <li>A text editor</li>
        <li>Go compiler</li>
        <br>
        <h2>Text Editor</h2>
        <p>You will require a text editor to type your programs. Examples of text editors include Windows Notepad, OS Edit command, Brief, Epsilon, EMACS, and vim or vi. <br><br>

          The name and version of text editors can vary on different operating systems. For example, Notepad is used on Windows, and vim or vi is used on Windows as well as Linux or UNIX.<br><br>
          
          The files you create with the text editor are called source files. They contain program source code. The source files for Go programs are typically named with the extension ".go".<br><br>
          
          Before starting your programming, make sure you have a text editor in place and you have enough experience to write a computer program, save it in a file, compile it, and finally execute it.</p><br><br>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="Program_Structure" class="main-section">
      <header>Program Structure</header><br><br>
      <p>Before we study the basic building blocks of Go programming language, let us first discuss the bare minimum structure of Go programs so that we can take it as a reference in subsequent chapters.</p>
      <p>A Go program basically consists of the following parts −</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Package Declaration</li>
        <li>Import Packages</li>
        <li>Functions</li>
        <li>Variables</li>
        <li>Statements and Expressions</li>
        <li>Comments</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Let us look at a simple code that would print the words "Hello World" −</p>
      <code>package main<br>
        import "fmt"
        <br>
        func main() { 
          <br>
           /* This is my first sample program. */
           <br>
           fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
        }</code>
      <ul>
        <li>The first line of the program package main defines the package name in which this program should lie. It is a mandatory statement, as Go programs run in packages. The main package is the starting point to run the program. Each package has a path and name associated with it.</li>
        <li>The next line import "fmt" is a preprocessor command which tells the Go compiler to include the files lying in the package fmt.</li>
        <li>The next line func main() is the main function where the program execution begins.</li>
        <li>The next line /*...*/ is ignored by the compiler and it is there to add comments in the program. Comments are also represented using // similar to Java or C++ comments.</li>
        <li>The next line fmt.Println(...) is another function available in Go which causes the message "Hello, World!" to be displayed on the screen. Here fmt package has exported Println method which is used to display the message on the screen.</li>
        <li>Notice the capital P of Println method. In Go language, a name is exported if it starts with capital letter. Exported means the function or variable/constant is accessible to the importer of the respective package.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Executing a Go Program</h2>
        <p>Let us discuss how to save the source code in a file, compile it, and finally execute the program. Please follow the steps given below −</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Open a text editor and add the above-mentioned code.</li>
        <li>Save the file as hello.go</li>
        <li>Open the command prompt.</li>
        <li>Go to the directory where you saved the file.</li>
        <li>Type go run hello.go and press enter to run your code.</li>
        <li>If there are no errors in your code, then you will see "Hello World!" printed on the screen.</li>
        <br>
        <code>
          $ go run hello.go 
          <br>
          Hello, World!
        </code>
      </ul>
    </section>
    <section id="Basic_Syntax" class="main-section">
      <header>Basic Syntax</header>
      <h2>Tokens in Go</h2>
      <p>A Go program consists of various tokens. A token is either a keyword, an identifier, a constant, a string literal, or a symbol. For example, the following Go statement consists of six tokens −</p>
      <code>
        fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
      </code>
      <p>The individual tokens are −</p>
      <code>
        fmt<br>
        .<br>
        Println<br>
        (<br>
        "Hello, World!"<br>
        )<br>
      </code>
        <h2>Line Separator</h2>
        <p>In a Go program, the line separator key is a statement terminator. That is, individual statements don't need a special separator like “;” in C. The Go compiler internally places “;” as the statement terminator to indicate the end of one logical entity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>For example, take a look at the following statements −</p>
        <br>
        <code>
          fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
          <br>
          fmt.Println("I am in Go Programming World!")
        </code>
        <br>
        <h2>
          Comments
        </h2>
        <p>Comments are like helping texts in your Go program and they are ignored by the compiler. They start with /* and terminates with the characters */ as shown below −</p>
        <code>
          /* my first program in Go */
        </code>
        <p>You cannot have comments within comments and they do not occur within a string or character literals.</p>
        <h2>Identifiers</h2>
        <p>A Go identifier is a name used to identify a variable, function, or any other user-defined item. An identifier starts with a letter A to Z or a to z or an underscore _ followed by zero or more letters, underscores, and digits (0 to 9).<br><br>
          identifier = letter { letter | unicode_digit }.
          <br>
          Go does not allow punctuation characters such as @, $, and % within identifiers. Go is a case-sensitive programming language. Thus, Manpower and manpower are two different identifiers in Go. Here are some examples of acceptable identifiers −
        </p><br>
        <code>
          mahesh      kumar   abc   move_name   a_123 <br>
          myname50   _temp    j      a23b9      retVal
        </code>
        <h2>Whitespace in Go</h2>
        Whitespace is the term used in Go to describe blanks, tabs, newline characters, and comments. A line containing only whitespace, possibly with a comment, is known as a blank line, and a Go compiler totally ignores it.
        <br><br>
        Whitespaces separate one part of a statement from another and enables the compiler to identify where one element in a statement, such as int, ends and the next element begins. Therefore, in the following statement −<br><br>
        <code>
          var age int;
        </code> <br>
        <p>There must be at least one whitespace character (usually a space) between int and age for the compiler to be able to distinguish them. On the other hand, in the following statement −</p> <br>
        <code>fruit = apples + oranges;   // get the total fruit</code> <br> <br>
        <p>No whitespace characters are necessary between fruit and =, or between = and apples, although you are free to include some if you wish for readability purpose. </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Data_Types" class="main-section">
      <header>Data Types</header>
      <p>In the Go programming language, data types refer to an extensive system used for declaring variables or functions of different types. The type of a variable determines how much space it occupies in storage and how the bit pattern stored is interpreted.</p> <br><br>
      <p>The types in Go can be classified as follows −</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Boolean types</li>
        <li>Numeric types</li>
        <li>String types</li>
        <li>Derived types</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Array types and structure types are collectively referred to as aggregate types. The type of a function specifies the set of all functions with the same parameter and result types. We will discuss the basic types in the following section, whereas other types will be covered in the upcoming chapters.</p>
      <br><br>
      <h2>Integer Types
      </h2>
      <p>The predefined architecture-independent integer types are −</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Variables" class="main-section">
      <header>Variables</header>
      <p>Up until now we have only seen programs that use literal values (numbers, strings, etc.) but such programs aren't particularly useful. To make truly useful programs we need to learn two new concepts: variables and control flow statements. This chapter will explore variables in more detail. <br>
        A variable is a storage location, with a specific type and an associated name. Let's change the program we wrote in chapter 2 so that it uses a variable:</p>
        <code>
          package main
          <br>
          import "fmt"
          <br>
          func main() {
            <br>
          var x string = "Hello World"<br>
          fmt.Println(x)<br>
}
        </code>
        <p>Variable Definition in Go

          A variable definition tells the compiler where and how much storage to create for the variable. A variable definition specifies a data type and contains a list of one or more variables of that type as follows −</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Constants" class="main-section">
      <header>Constants</header>
      <p>Constants refer to fixed values that the program may not alter during its execution. These fixed values are also called literals.
      <br>
        Constants can be of any of the basic data types like an integer constant, a floating constant, a character constant, or a string literal. There are also enumeration constants as well.
        <br>
        Constants are treated just like regular variables except that their values cannot be modified after their definition.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section id="Operators" class="main-section">
      <header>Operators</header>
      <p>An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical manipulations. Go language is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators −</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Decision_Making" class="main-section">
      <header>Decision Making</header>
      <p>Decision making structures require that the programmer specify one or more conditions to be evaluated or tested by the program, along with a statement or statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be true, and optionally, other statements to be executed if the condition is determined to be false.
        <br>
        Following is the general form of a typical decision making structure found in most of the programming languages −</p>
    </section>
    <section id="Loops" class="main-section">
      <header>
        Loops
      </header>
      <p>
        There may be a situation, when you need to execute a block of code several number of times. In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on.
        <br>
Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.
        <br>
A loop statement allows us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times and following is the general form of a loop statement in most of the programming languages −
